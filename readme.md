# React blog

This project is a test for a few technologies, it was created using Vite with react and TypeScript. The go is to fetch my blog and display the info with some custom components:

- For styling, I have used CSS and emotional with a theme file
- To fetch the data from my blog, I have used redux toolkit
- To create different routes, I have installed react-router
- To keep the code standard, I have installed eslint and prettier
- To display the icons, I have used a component to load a sprite.

## Things to improve

- The contrast between colours could be an accessibility issue
- Add Coding split(Lazy loading) at the components
- Add unit and e2e tests
- Add internationalization for static strings
